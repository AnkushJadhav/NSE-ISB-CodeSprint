This problem is all about share prices and moving averages!

You are given n integers p1,p2,...,pn, where pi denotes the price of the stock at day i.

Then, we define: 

STMA(i) := the average price of the stock over days i,i-1,i-2,...,i-59, so it is an average measured at day i over the most recent 60 days. This value is called Short term moving average.

LTMA(i) := the average price of the stock over days i,i-1,i-2,...,i-299, so it is an average measured at day i over the most recent 300 days. This value is called Long term moving average.

Notice that STMA(i) is defined for 60<=i<=n, while LTMA(i) is defined for 300<=i<=n.

In this problem, values of STMA(i) and LTMA(i) are rounded to exactly 2 decimal points, so for example 44.3449 is rounded to 44.34, while 35.11511 is rounded to 35.12.

Now, let's say that a crossover occurs at day i if and only if both STMA(i) and LTMA(i) are defined at days i and i-1, and either one of the below conditions is fulfilled: 
1. STMA(i-1)>LTMA(i-1) and STMA(i)<=LTMA(i)
2. STMA(i-1)<LTMA(i-1) and STMA(i)>=LTMA(i)
3. STMA(i-1)=LTMA(i-1) and STMA(i)!=LTMA(i)

Given the stock prices across  days, detect all crossovers. For each crossover, print the day at which it occurred along with the values of STMA and LTMA for this day.

Input Format:

The first line of input contains a single integer n(the number of days).

The second line of input contains n space-separated integers p1,p2,...,pn denoting the stock prices for each day.

Constraints:
300<n<=1000
1<=pi<=100000

Output Format:

For each occurrence of a crossover, print three space-separated values for the date at which it occurred, the value of STMA for this date, and the value of LTMA for this date. Print each crossover on its own line and order the crossovers in order from the smallest date to the largest. The values of both STMA and LTMA must be correct to 2 decimal places.
